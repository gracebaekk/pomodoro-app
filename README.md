## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Set a pomodoro timer and short & long break timers
- Customize how long each timer runs for
- See a circular progress bar that updates every minute and represents how far through their timer they are
- Customize the appearance of the app with the ability to set preferences for colors and fonts

### What I learned

Working on this Pomodoro app reinforced my understanding of React state management and React hooks, especially useState and useEffect. I learned how to dynamically switch button states based on the timer's progress and manage a countdown using setInterval. Additionally, I explored how to use the react-circular-progressbar package to create a visual progress indicator.

### Continued development

Working on adding a feature to track progress of total number of sessions completed and notifications!
